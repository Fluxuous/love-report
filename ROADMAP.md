# Love Report — Roadmap

## v2.1 — Highest Good Scoring (Current)

Eight ethical dimensions scored by AI for every curated story. Hover/long-press tooltips show per-dimension breakdowns. About page explains the philosophical framework.

- 8 dimensions: Courage, Impact, Justice, Compassion, Harmony, Grace, Truth, Transcendence
- Weighted composite score (0.0–10.0, Pitchfork-style)
- Score tooltip on hover (desktop) / long-press (mobile)
- Full About page with philosophical roots, tensions, methodology
- Backward compatible with unscored stories

## v2.2 — Newsletter

Email digest with top-scored stories. Weekly or daily frequency option. Highlights the most interesting dimension tensions of the week — not just highest scores, but stories where Grace and Justice pulled in opposite directions, or where Courage and Harmony collided.

## v2.3 — Nonprofit Ad Network

Hand-curated advertisements for genuine nonprofits only. No programmatic ads. No tracking pixels. No behavioral targeting. Strict editorial requirements: the nonprofit must demonstrate real impact, not just good marketing.

Revenue sustains the project as a nonprofit entity with a modest founder salary. The ads themselves are curated with the same editorial philosophy as the stories.

## v3 — Human Scoring (Rotten Tomatoes Model)

Readers vote on each dimension for each story, creating a collective moral judgment alongside the AI's scores.

- **AI Score**: Consistent, scalable, philosophically grounded but ultimately synthetic
- **Human Score**: Messy, diverse, grounded in lived experience
- **The Gap**: Where AI and humans agree — and where they diverge — is itself data. What does it tell us about our moral intuitions vs. our philosophical frameworks?

The site becomes not just a mirror but a participatory experiment in collective ethics.

## v3.1 — Additional Metric Sets

- Deontological vs. utilitarian axis
- Custom user weighting (adjust dimension weights to reflect your own values)
- "Show me the most courageous stories" / "Show me the most just stories" filtering

## v3.2 — User Accounts & Personalization

- Save preferred weights
- Bookmark stories
- Scoring history
- Personal moral profile over time

## Future Ideas

- **API**: Let other sites embed Highest Good scores
- **Embeddable Score Widget**: A small badge any news site can add
- **Highest Good Leaderboard**: Which sources consistently produce the highest-scored stories?
- **Historical Archive**: Searchable archive of scored stories, trends over time
- **Podcast/Audio**: Weekly audio digest of the highest-scored stories
